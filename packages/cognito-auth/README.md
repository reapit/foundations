A thin wrapper around the AWS SDK and OAuth flow to take the pain out of authenticating your App with Reapit Connect.

## DEPRECATED - Please use https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reapit/connect-session

We will continue to offer patches and bugfixes for this package however, we strongly suggest that you migrate to `@reapit/connect-session` for a light-weight solution when working with Reapit Connect; a more comprehensive, simpler API and better developer experience.
