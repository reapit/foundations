A thin wrapper around the AWS SDK and OAuth flow to take the pain out of authenticating your App with Reapit Connect. Usage see: [here](https://foundations-documentation.reapit.cloud/open-source/packages#cognito-auth).

## DEPRECATED

We will continue to offer patches and bugfixes for this package however, we strongly suggest that you migrate to `@reapit/connect-session` for a lighter weight solution when working with Reapit Connect; a more comprehensive, simpler API and better developer experience.
