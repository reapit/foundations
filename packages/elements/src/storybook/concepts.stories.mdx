# Basic Concepts and Patterns


## Component Syntax
- Component casing

- Composing classes
- Intents

### Typical usage of each intent

| Intent    | Usage                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| primary   | The main/most likely action a user might want to take                                                  |
| secondary | Typically used alonside a primary button to offer an alternative action, e.g. a Cancel or Close button |
| critical  | An action that should be the very next, or only logical action that a user can take                    |
| success   | An action that would lead to a good or pleasant outcome                                                |
| danger    | An action that would lead to a potentially bad or dangerous outcome, e.g a delete button               |
| neutral   | An action that has no specific meaning - essentially no intent is inferred from                        |

- El prefixing
- Overides with Modifiers - Adding classNames
- Inheriting base element properties
- Theming
