# Introduction

Welcome to Reapit Elements UI Library.

Within this Storybook, there are all the basic components and classes you will need to build clean, composable UI interfaces for the Reapit Marketplace and Platform.

The UI library itself is based on the Reapit Foundations Design system which is distributed as a [public Figma file here](https://www.figma.com/file/5fLETXbCWmA5R87gycjPZb/Design-System?node-id=2936%3A2572). To get a sense  of the thinking behind the library and for information on the base design principles behind it, we would advise strongly looking at the design system before getting started with your Elements project.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Elements is distributed via NPM as a CommonJS, ESM and UDM module. Your first step is, with NodeJS installed, to run;

```bash
npm install @reapit/elements

# or for, yan users

yarn add @reapit/elements
```

You can then import the modules into your project in the normal way;

```ts
import { Input } from '@reapit/elememts'

// Or for CommonJS users

const { Input } = require('@reapit/elements')
```

You will also need to add the exported stylesheet from the dist folder of the library, to the entry point of your application eg;

```tsx
import '@reapit/elements/dist/index.css'

// CommonJS 

require('@reapit/elements/dist/index.css')
```

or in a css file

```css

@import '~@reapit/elements/dist/index.css';

```

And that's it - the stylesheet will include the PT Sans Google Font and some basic defaults, with the component CSS classes providng the majority of the styles.

### Dependencies

From the outset, we have aimed to keep the library purely presentational with as few dependencies as possible. The basic reasoning for this is;

- Small footpint - we don't want to bloat your project.
- Developer flexibility - you can use your preferred libraries and frameworks alongside Elements, not competing against it.
- Limited vendor buy in - we are not depedent on other libraries update paths and API changes when developing Elements.

As such there is only one core dependency on the React side of the library - the Excellent [Linaria CSS in JS package](https://github.com/callstack/linaria). The reason for using this over other CSS pre-processors are as follows;

- Zero runtime so it's extremely performant. 
- CSS extraction - we can export the CSS in our CSS at compile time.
- Friendly, semantic class names - the `camelCased` class names and `PascalCased` components can be output to readable `kebab-case` CSS classes, with no hashed ids.
- Tiny footprint - the core library is [only 282b](https://bundlephobia.com/package/linaria@2.1.0)!

Because the project is compiled, you should have no issues using Linaria components out the box. If you want to use it yourself alongside Elements, please see the [integration guide here](https://github.com/callstack/linaria/blob/master/docs/BUNDLERS_INTEGRATION.md).

Aside from Linaria, if you are using the React components, obviously you will need to have both `react` and `react-dom` as peer dependencies.

On the CSS side, there are no dependencies or external libraries.

### Using the Docs

When using this Storybook, it is worth drawing attention to the tabs at the top of the page - `docs` and `canvas`.

The `docs` tab is the best starting place in most cases as 

The `canvas` tab is best used for inspecting the components and looking at how they behave in a browser-like environment. They do not display the markdown documentation so please refer back to the `docs` tab for commentry on usage.

### Non React Users

One of our core motivators for the library was that while the library is built in React, we want to 

 Rendered HTML block for non react users
 HTML tab in canvas

### Browser Support

Because of the extensive use of CSS Variables, and other modern CSS features like grid and flexbox, support is limited to modern browsers i.e. Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox.

When building for the Reapit Marketplace, your application will render in a Chromium browser, currently at version 69 although we expect this to upgrade to a more recent version in the coming months. We will always support the Reapit Marketplace Chromium version as a minimum version.

### Migrating From v2

TODO - Expand these - just adding some notes for now

- Why migrate? Size, maintenence, feature requests, changelog, Design system
- Link to v2 Storybook 
- Explain v2 exports v3 to allow incremental updates

### Issues

If you find a bug with any of the components, please report it through [this link](https://github.com/reapit/foundations/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2C+needs-triage%2C+elements&template=bug_report.md&title=) to our Github Issues page.

We are also open to feature requests - in the same way please request [here](https://github.com/reapit/foundations/issues/new?assignees=&labels=external-request%2C+needs-triage%2C+elements&template=feature_request.md&title=) and if it makes sense with our roadmap and the wider design system, we will accept for development.
