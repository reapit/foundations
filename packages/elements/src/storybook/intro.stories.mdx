# Introduction

Welcome to Reapit Elements UI Library.

Within this Storybook, there are all the basic components and classes you will need to build clean, composable UI interfaces for the Reapit Marketplace and Platform.

## Getting Started

TODO - Expand these - just adding some notes for now

- Using the docs

- Intents

### Typical usage of each intent

| Intent    | Usage                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| primary   | The main/most likely action a user might want to take                                                  |
| secondary | Typically used alonside a primary button to offer an alternative action, e.g. a Cancel or Close button |
| critical  | An action that should be the very next, or only logical action that a user can take                    |
| success   | An action that would lead to a good or pleasant outcome                                                |
| danger    | An action that would lead to a potentially bad or dangerous outcome, e.g a delete button               |
