# Theming

One of the core objectives for the v3 re-write of Elements was to support Global theming. We have achieved this by using CSS Variables throughout the project that are loaded globally on the `:root` selector when importing the Elements stylesheet into your code (see getting started).

CSS Variables rely on the same rules of specificity as all CSS selectors, so you are able to theme your project globally, by adding a more specific class or id to the root selector of your project and in a CSS file, just override the pre-defined variables.

If you want your theming to be localised to an individual component and leave the globals alone, just apply a custom class to your Reapit Element component that re-defines the variable you wish to change.

## Basic Example

Here we are overriding the `--intent-primary` variable by wrapping the component in a class to make both a primary `Icon` and a `Button` go green rather than the standard primary blue.

In both examples the markup is identical however, the demo wrapper component has overridden the default `--intent-primary` value by simply setting `--intent-primary: #a0c862;`

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Basic Example">
    <Button intent="primary">Button Text</Button>
    <DemoThemeWrapper>
      <Button intent="primary">Button Text</Button>
    </DemoThemeWrapper>
    <Icon intent="primary" icon="cloud" fontSize="2rem" />
    <DemoThemeWrapper>
      <Icon intent="primary" icon="cloud" fontSize="2rem" />
    </DemoThemeWrapper>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="Theming" story="Basic Example" />

## Available Variables

The variable usage is project wide - literally every component uses some of the variables - so it would be impossible to document all of the places they are used however, you can view a list of the available variables on [Github here](https://github.com/reapit/foundations/blob/master/packages/elements/src/styles/globals.ts#L171).
