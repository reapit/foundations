# Portal

> React only

Wrap any component inside a `Portal` and it will be rendered outside the normal DOM flow by React. This is useful for rendering Modals and other components like notifications that should appear outside your normal page content.

You just need to specify a target id on the page and the rest is done for you.

## Basic Usage

Because the portal is a wrapper, you should check the DOM tree to see where the example is appended with dev tools. In the example, we are targeting Storybook's `#docs-root`. This is used practically by the `useModal` hook.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Portal usage">
    <Portal id="docs-root">
      <div>I am a Portal Example!</div>
    </Portal>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
