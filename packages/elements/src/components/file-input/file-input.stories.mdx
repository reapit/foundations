# FileInput

The input component is by design just a styled html / react component to allow developers maximum flexibility to use whatever form library they choose, or simply by listening on the native `onChange` event, accessing the `value` property of the input.

You may also wish to add your own custom elements eg a JS Datepicker - in this case, just target the default input with your own custom component or use the CSS classes provided.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="File Input">
    <FileInput />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="FileInput" story="File Input" />
