# SecondaryNav

A secondary navigation component for rendering sub-pages. Typical use case would be for when you would usually use tabs.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Basic Usage">
    <SecondaryNav>
      <SecondaryNavItem>App List</SecondaryNavItem>
      <SecondaryNavItem active>Create App</SecondaryNavItem>
    </SecondaryNav>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="SecondaryNav" story="Basic Usage" />

Supply as children, as many `<SecondaryNavItem>` tags as required.

## SecondaryNavItem

Use `SecondaryNavItem` as a child of `SecondaryNav`. It accepts the following props, as well as any other standard HTML or React attribute for `<div>`, e.g. `onClick`

## React example with `useState`

The props accepted by the `SecondaryNavItem` are below - the `SecondaryNav` itself only accepts standard HTML attributes.

<ArgsTable of={SecondaryNavItem} />

<Canvas>
  <Story name="React example">
    {() => {
      const [selectedItem, setSelectedItem] = useState(1)
      return (
        <SecondaryNav>
          <SecondaryNavItem active={selectedItem === 1} onClick={() => setSelectedItem(1)}>
            App List
          </SecondaryNavItem>
          <SecondaryNavItem active={selectedItem === 2} onClick={() => setSelectedItem(2)}>
            Create App
          </SecondaryNavItem>
        </SecondaryNav>
      )
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
