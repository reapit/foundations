# PlaceholderImage

The placeholder image component works very similarly to the Icon component. You can specify from a choice of placeholders by name and specify a size as a numeric value (of pixels), for the image to be scaled to within the placholder container.

For non-React users, we export all the icons from `@reapit/elements/assets` where they are grouped in the `placholder-images` folder eg `import placeholderSmall from "@reapit/elements/assets/placholder-images/placeholderSmall.svg"`. You can then wrap your SVG in the appropriate classes you see in the rendered markup with each story in these docs.

<ArgsTable story="Basic Usage" />

## Basic Usage

For a basic icon, just select a placholder name from one of the tables below and set a size in pixels.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Basic Usage">
    <PlaceholderImage placeholder="placeholderSmall" size={100} />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="PlaceholderImage" story={['Basic Usage']} />

## Placeholder Images

See below for the images we currently export from the project.

| Icon Name        | Largest Icon                                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| placeholderSmall | <PlaceholderImage placeholder="placeholderSmall" size={100} /> |
| placeholderLarge | <PlaceholderImage placeholder="placeholderLarge" size={400} /> |
