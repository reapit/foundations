# Modal

The modal component renders a dialog box that overlays the main screen. It is typically used for displaying confirmation or error notifications to users that require an addtional call to action or step.

## Basic Usage

The Modal component can be used for UI purposes only, but won't have the functionality of the React implementation (i.e. managing the state of whether it is open or closed)

If using the Modal component like this, you will need to toggle the `elIsActive` / `el-is-active` class to show/hide the modal.

This class must be applied on two elements, `div.el-modal-bg` and also `div.el-modal`, when you want the modal to be shown.

By default, the modal fills it's current container so you will likely wish to place it as high as possible up the DOM tree to achive an overlay effect.

Click "Show code" below to see JSX / HTML code for a closed modal, along with the corresponding rendered markup. To see how an opened one behaves and the markup, move to the React examples below.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Basic Usage - Closed">
    <ModalBg />
    <ModalContainer>
      <ModalHeader>Welcome to the demo modal</ModalHeader>
      <ModalBody>
        <BodyText>Here's some nice content for the inside of the modal.</BodyText>
      </ModalBody>
    </ModalContainer>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="Modal" story="Basic Usage - Closed" />

## React usage

The React component accepts props to toggle the classes that control whether the modal is opened or not.

In React world, you will likely want to trigger the modal using a portal (see our `Portal` component), so it can be rendered at the top level of your app and provide an overlay effect. Probably you will `useState` to toggle the hide and show behaviour.

This example gives maxmum flexibility but for the 'batteries included' approach, you should look at the `useModal` hook below.

Props available for the React version of the component;

<ArgsTable component={Modal} />

<Canvas>
  <Story name="React Modal">
    {() => {
      const [modalIsOpen, setModalIsOpen] = useState(false)
      return (
        <>
          <Button intent="primary" onClick={() => setModalIsOpen(!modalIsOpen)}>
            Open Modal
          </Button>
          <Modal
            isOpen={modalIsOpen}
            onModalClose={() => setModalIsOpen(!modalIsOpen)}
            title="Welcome to the demo modal"
          >
            <BodyText>Here's some nice content for the inside of the modal.</BodyText>
          </Modal>
        </>
      )
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## React usage - Complete example with `useModal` hook

The use modal hook exports both a modal component and state helpers for toggling the component open.

It also leverages our `Portal` component to render the modal at the top level of your app. The default container is `#root` so if you need your portal to render on another element, pass a different id to the `useModal` hook when you instantiate it - in the example below, we use Storybook's `#docs-root`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="useModal example">
    {() => {
      const { Modal: ModalComponent, openModal, closeModal } = useModal('docs-root')
      return (
        <>
          <Button intent="primary" onClick={openModal}>
            Open Modal
          </Button>
          <ModalComponent title="Welcome to the demo modal">
            <BodyText>Here's some nice content for the inside of the modal.</BodyText>
            <FlexContainer isFlexJustifyCenter>
              <Button intent="primary" onClick={closeModal}>
                Close the modal
              </Button>
            </FlexContainer>
          </ModalComponent>
        </>
      )
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## React usage - With multiple `useModal` hooks

Props available for the React version of the component;

<ArgsTable component={Modal} />

If using multiple modals within a component, ensure you rename the exports from `useModal` to avoid conflicts, e.g. `const { Modal: ModalA, openModal: openModalA } = useModal()`

<Canvas>
  <Story name="useModal example - multiple modals">
    {() => {
      const { Modal: ModalA, openModal: openModalA } = useModal('docs-root')
      const { Modal: ModalB, openModal: openModalB } = useModal('docs-root')
      return (
        <>
          <ButtonGroup>
            <Button intent="primary" onClick={openModalA}>
              Open Modal A
            </Button>
            <Button intent="primary" onClick={openModalB}>
              Open Modal B
            </Button>
          </ButtonGroup>
          <ModalA title="Modal A">I'm the modal A's content</ModalA>
          <ModalB title="Modal B">I'm the modal B's content</ModalB>
        </>
      )
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## `useModal` API

Exports the following properties as an object:

- `Modal`: `FC<Partial<ModalProps>>` - a React component that should be placed somewhere with the component that you want to use the modal. Will pass props to the underlying modal.
- `openModal`: `() => void` - a method that will open the Modal.
- `closeModal`: `() => void` - a method that will close the Modal. The Modal can also be closed by default from within the Modal, or by clicking on the background
- `modalIsOpen`: `boolean` - convenience boolean to check if the modal is open currently.
