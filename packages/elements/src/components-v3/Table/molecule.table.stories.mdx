# Molecule - Table

<ArgsTable of={Table} />

`Table` only renders children, unless the `rows` prop is supplied, then it works in the React shorthand fashion. This is documented on the main Table story.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Rendering children">
    <Table>
      <p>
        A child component of Table. It is expected you would use another Table molecule here, but anything will render.
      </p>
    </Table>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="V3/Table/Molecules/Table" story="Rendering children" />

## Creating a smaller final column, by explicitly setting the number of columns (optional)

If you are using the expandable rows, you can set a react prop (or an HTML attribute if using raw HTML)
of `data-num-columns-excl-expandable-row-trigger-col` and enter the number of columns
present.

This will tell the CSS grid how many columns to render, and give you one extra small column for putting the `<TableExpandableRowTriggerCell>`
in since this doesn't need a lot of space. Valid values are any string between 2 and 12.

Since an extra column is automatically added to give you space for the `<TableExpandableRowTriggerCell>` component, you should enter
the number of columns required **excluding** the one for the `<TableExpandableRowTriggerCell>`.

If using the Table component in React shorthand mode, `data-num-columns-excl-expandable-row-trigger-col` is set automatically for you.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Setting the number of cols">
    <Table data-num-columns-excl-expandable-row-trigger-col="4">
      <p>A child component of Table. Different styles will be applied to other Table molecules now.</p>
    </Table>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="V3/Table/Molecules/Table" story="Setting the number of cols" />
