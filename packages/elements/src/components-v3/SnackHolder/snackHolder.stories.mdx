# SnackHolder

Underlying tag: `<div>`

This component is essentially invisible. It is used automatically as part of the `<SnackProvider>` component, so if you are a React user you shouldn't need to use this component on it's own.

`SnackHolder`'s purpose is to group snacks and dispaly them in the corner of the screen above all other content.

If you are using this library without react, you may find is useful for putting `Snack`'s inside of.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default Usage">
    <SnackHolder />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<RenderHtmlMarkup component="V3/SnackHolder" story="Default Usage" />

<ArgsTable of={SnackHolder} />

## Other attributes

All other standard HTML attributes for `<div>` are supported and are passed through to the React component
