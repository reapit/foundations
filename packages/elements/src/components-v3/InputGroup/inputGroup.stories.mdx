# InputGroup

Underlying tag: `<div>`

InputGroup provides a wrapper and styling for the `Input`, `Icon`, and `Label` components, so that they can work nicely together.

### Usage with HTML & CSS only

- The order of the child components matters, in order to make the focus state work (i.e. the different styling applied when you click into the component)
- The `<input>` component must come first in the DOM, before the `<label>` and the `<span>` for the icon, as is shown in the HTML docs

### Usage with React

- You can supply the child components individually (ensure the `Input` component is included as the first child)
- Or, there is also a shorthand for React where you can supply props. This only works if _no children_ are supplied

# Complete example, with icon and label

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With label and icon">
    <InputGroup>
      <Input id="myId" type="text" />
      <Icon icon="username" />
      <Label for="myId">Enter your username</Label>
    </InputGroup>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

# With icon only

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With icon only">
    <InputGroup>
      <Input id="myId" type="tel" placeholder="Enter your mobile number" />
      <Icon icon="phone" />
    </InputGroup>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

# With label only

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With label only">
    <InputGroup>
      <Input id="myId" type="email" />
      <Label for="myId">Email address</Label>
    </InputGroup>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

# Shorthand usage for React users

Any additional props are added to the `Input` component that is rendered as part of `InputGroup`,
except for `className` which is only applied to the parent `InputGroup` div

<ArgsTable of={InputGroup} />

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Shorthand usage for React users">
    <InputGroup icon="home" label="Please enter an address" type="text" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

# Other attributes

All other standard HTML attributes for `<div>` are supported and are passed through to the React component.
