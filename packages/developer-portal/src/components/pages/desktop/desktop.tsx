      <p>
        Reapit&#39;s Agency Cloud is a desktop application that offers estate agencies a comprehensive range of market
        leading agency products, including a Sales CRM, Lettings CRM, Client Accounts, Property Management and real-time
        Analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developers that would like to integrate with or extend the functionality of Agency Cloud can use the Foundations
        Desktop API to build web applications for Reapit&#39;s app Marketplace that trigger events in the Agency Cloud
        desktop application, as well as associating their apps with common actions in Agency Cloud to replace default
        behaviours and screens.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a developer building a Marketplace app that provides AML and ID checking, can use the Desktop API
        to associate their app with the default ID checking screen in Agency Cloud. When a customer clicks the default
        button to launch the ID check screen, the developer&#39;s associated app would be presented instead.
      </p>

            The Developer Edition of Agency Cloud allows developers using the Desktop API to test their apps within the
            desktop application using sandbox data.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no charge for the Developer Edition licence during the Beta phase, however, developers are required
            to confirm the subscription to proceed. When the Beta phase comes to an end, we will automatically cancel
            all subscriptions, and developers will need to sign-up again should they wish to subscribe and pay for a
            Developer Edition license.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application is licenced per user/developer of an organisation and will require a Windows machine to
            install it.
