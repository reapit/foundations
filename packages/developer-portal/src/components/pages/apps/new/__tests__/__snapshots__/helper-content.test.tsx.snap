            Your application can be authenticated against our Platform either on the client-side or server-side. If you choose client-side authentication at the next step but later wish to upgrade to a full AgencyCloud integration in the future, you can do this. However, it is important to note, server-side integrations cannot be launched from within AgencyCloud.

             to authenticate against our API. Your application will need to re-direct to Reapit Connect where we will handle user login and in turn, re-direct back to your app with a code in the URL that you exchange for access and id JWTs, referred to as
             
            <a>
              Authorization Code flow.

              Client Credentials authentication flow.

            Unlike client-side applications, you do not have to re-direct to Reapit Connect, nor do your users have to log into your application.

           You will need to provide us with URIs to your application at the next step so we know where to return you to on login and on completion of this wizard, you will receive a Client ID you will need to get started.

          To make this process easier, we provide you with an authentication module for client-side apps,

            Connect Session

          , which comes bundled with our
           
          <a>
            Create React App Template
          </a>
           for quick start client-side development.

          Server-side applications authenticate against our API using the
           
          <a>
            Client Credentials authentication flow.
          </a>
           This process involves the exchange of a Client Id and Secret for a JWT access token to authenticate against all requests.

          Unlike client-side applications, you do not have to re-direct to Reapit Connect, nor do your users have to log into your application. Because of this, the flow must only be used on the Server Side to ensure the Client Secret you will be issued at the end of this wizard is held in a secure location.

          When using the Reapit Connect
           
          <a>
            Authorization Code flow,
          </a>
           you need to register both a re-direct URI and a logout URI. The former is the location in your app, you want Reapit Connect to re-direct to after a successful user login, the latter, after a succesful logout. Only URIs that are registered here will be accepted as a location by Reapit Connect although, you can register multiple locations with a comma separated list.

           however, any localhost (for local development), or https URI is acceptable. Please note, the URIs must match those in your app exactly, inclusive of white space and trailing slashes.

          Permissions are registered as scopes against the access token you receive back from one of our Authentication Flows. They map 1:1 and on a read/write basis to endpoints in our our Platform REST API. As such, it is worth looking at the

          For some flows we have pre-populated suggested permissions based on what you have said you wish to acheive with our Platform. These can be removed or added as you see fit and all permissions can be edited later if you wish to add or remove them before your app goes live.
