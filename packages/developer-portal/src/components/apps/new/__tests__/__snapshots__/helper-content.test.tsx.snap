                Every developer will have different use cases for our Platform and it is unlikely you will need to use all of the APIs and tooling we provide. However, the starting point for all integrations is to create an ‘App’,

                On a basic level an app is the means to authenticate against our services. To create an app, you should follow the steps in the wizard on the left of this page.
              </p>

                class="el-text-base el-body-text el-has-grey-text"
              >
                When you have completed this wizard, you will land on a dedicated page for your App, that will give you the Client Id, and in the case of server-side apps, a Client Secret, that will enable you to authenticate against out APIs. From here you can get started with development against our developer sandbox data.

                When you are ready to go live with a customer, you will need to complete some additional information and submit your app for review by one of our team. On approval of your app, it will be listed in the AppMarket for your customers to install, this will then grant access to their production data.

                You can either launch your app from a dedicated menu, for example from a property or a contact, or even replace certain screens. Using our Desktop API your app can receive contextual information based on the screen or location the app is launched from. Providing relevant data for your users. For more information on our Desktop API please

            Your application can be authenticated against our Platform either on the client-side or server-side. If you choose client-side authentication at the next step but later wish to upgrade to a full Reapit CRM integration in the future, you can do this. However, it is important to note, server-side integrations cannot be launched from within Reapit CRM.

                Unlike client-side applications, you do not have to re-direct to Reapit Connect, nor do your users have to log into your application. Because of this, the flow must only be used on the Server Side to ensure the Client Secret you will be issued at the end of this wizard is held in a secure location.

              On a basic level an app is the means to authenticate against our services. To create an app, you should follow the steps in the wizard on the left of this page.

              When you have completed this wizard, you will land on a dedicated page for your App, that will give you the Client Id, and in the case of server-side apps, a Client Secret, that will enable you to authenticate against out APIs. From here you can get started with development against our developer sandbox data.

              When you are ready to go live with a customer, you will need to complete some additional information and submit your app for review by one of our team. On approval of your app, it will be listed in the AppMarket for your customers to install, this will then grant access to their production data.

              Server-side applications authenticate against our API using the
               
              <a>
                Client Credentials authentication flow.
              </a>
               This process involves the exchange of a Client Id and Secret for a JWT access token to authenticate against all requests.

              Unlike client-side applications, you do not have to re-direct to Reapit Connect, nor do your users have to log into your application. Because of this, the flow must only be used on the Server Side to ensure the Client Secret you will be issued at the end of this wizard is held in a secure location.

            Authorization Code flow,
          </a>
           you need to register both a re-direct URI and a logout URI. The former is the location in your app, you want Reapit Connect to re-direct to after a successful user login, the latter, after a succesful logout. Only URIs that are registered here will be accepted as a location by Reapit Connect although, you can register multiple locations with a comma separated list.

           however, any localhost or dev.reapit (for local development), or https URI is acceptable. Please note, the URIs must match those in your app exactly, inclusive of white space and trailing slashes.

          Permissions are registered as scopes against the access token you receive back from one of our Authentication Flows. They map 1:1 and on a read/write basis to endpoints in our our Platform REST API. As such, it is worth looking at the

            API explorer here

          For some flows we have pre-populated suggested permissions based on what you have said you wish to acheive with our Platform. These can be removed or added as you see fit and all permissions can be edited later if you wish to add or remove them before your app goes live.
