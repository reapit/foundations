                Every developer will have different use cases for our Platform and it is unlikely you will need to use all of the APIs and tooling we provide. However, the starting point for all integrations is to create an ‘App’,

                On a basic level an app is the means to authenticate against our services. To create an app, you should follow the steps in the wizard on the left of this page.

                When you have completed this wizard, you will land on a dedicated page for your App, that will give you the Client Id, and in the case of server-side apps, a Client Secret, that will enable you to authenticate against out APIs. From here you can get started with development against our developer sandbox data.

                When you are ready to go live with a customer, you will need to complete some additional information and submit your app for review by one of our team. On approval of your app, it will be listed in the AppMarket for your customers to install, this will then grant access to their production data.

                You can either launch your app from a dedicated menu, for example from a property or a contact, or even replace certain screens. Using our Desktop API your app can receive contextual information based on the screen or location the app is launched from. Providing relevant data for your users.

                It is possible to get up and running with a website feed from the Platform API. You will want to optimise this flow, implementing webhooks and caching however, the below video is our quick start guide.

                When building a public website for a Reapit Customer, you will have no user authentication so your integration must be server-side, using our
                 
                <a>

            You will get options at the next steps to decide whether client or server-side authentication best serves your application needs however, in most cases web services applications are server-side using our

            Please be aware there is not a 1:1 mapping between the SOAP and our Platform REST API. As such, we suggest reading the

              Every developer will have different use cases for our Platform and it is unlikely you will need to use all of the APIs and tooling we provide. However, the starting point for all integrations is to create an ‘App’,

              On a basic level an app is the means to authenticate against our services. To create an app, you should follow the steps in the wizard on the left of this page.

            <mock-styled.p
              classname="mock-css."

              When you have completed this wizard, you will land on a dedicated page for your App, that will give you the Client Id, and in the case of server-side apps, a Client Secret, that will enable you to authenticate against out APIs. From here you can get started with development against our developer sandbox data.

              When you are ready to go live with a customer, you will need to complete some additional information and submit your app for review by one of our team. On approval of your app, it will be listed in the AppMarket for your customers to install, this will then grant access to their production data.
