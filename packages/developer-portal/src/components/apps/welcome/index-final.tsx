                    We have invested a considerable amount of time to ensure our documentation is as comprehensive as

                    questions.

                    Creating an app is the starting point for authenticating against the Foundations APIs. Your app
                    might be a web application, possibly rendered inside of the AgencyCloud CRM, or a simple data feed
                    to serve a website.

                    In all cases, you will need to use the app creation wizard that will walk you through creating your
                    app, explain key concepts along the way and link out to our documentation where relevant.

        <Title>About Foundations</Title>
        <BodyText hasGreyText>
          Reapit Foundations is a Software as a Service Platform that enables developers to access, update and enhance
          data within the Reapit AgencyCloud desktop CRM.
        </BodyText>
        <BodyText hasGreyText>
          There are a number of aspects to Foundations documented within this Developer Portal, specifically, APIs,
          Webhooks, a UI Library and Data Analytics solutions. We also have an AppMarketplace to facilitate the
          publishing and installation of the software you build on top of the Platform.
        </BodyText>
        <BodyText hasGreyText>
          Every developer will have different use cases for Foundations and it is unlikely you will need to use all of
          the APIs and tooling we provide. However, the starting point for all integrations is to create an
          &lsquo;App&rsquo;, which on a basic level is the means to authenticate aginst our services.
        </BodyText>
        <BodyText hasGreyText>
          Before getting started, please watch this short video with some Foundations Basics.
        </BodyText>
        <BodyText onClick={openModal}>
          <VideoImage width="100%" />
        </BodyText>
        <BodyText hasGreyText>
          When you have watched the video, please confirm this and your next step will be to create your first app using
          the wizard on the left hand side of this page. This will allow you to authenticated against our APIs.
