            Waiver and Variation:
            <TermsOl>
              <TermsLi>
                A failure or delay by a Party to exercise any right or remedy provided under this Agreement or by Law,

                shall it preclude or restrict any further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or
                partial exercise of any right or remedy provided under this Agreement or by Law, whether by conduct or
                otherwise, shall preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.

                A waiver of any right or remedy under this Agreement shall only be effective if given in writing and

                provided under this Agreement or by Law in relation to another Party does not affect its rights in
                relation to any other Party.

              <TermsLi>
