                Without prejudice to any other right or remedy Reapit may have and subject to the terms of clause 3.2, if the Developer fails to pay Reapit the Fees on or before the due date in respect of a valid and undisputed invoice, Reapit may charge interest on such sum from the due date for payment at the annual rate of 5% above the base lending rate from time to time of Barclays Bank accruing on a daily basis until payment is made whether before or after any judgment.

Following receipt of such notice from Reapit, the Developer has the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice to Reapit, such notice to be received by Reapit no later than 30 days prior the change taking effect.
