# Reapit React App Scaffolder

A CLI for generating React Apps, optimised for the marketplace, including Reapit Connect authentication and Elements.

For detailed documentation [visit here](https://foundations-documentation.reapit.cloud/open-source/packages#react-app-scaffolder).

For internal scaffolds, navigate to project folder and execute `yarn scaffold` to load the CLI.

## DEPRECATED

We will continue to offer patches and bugfixes for this package for internal Reapit Users however, for Reapit Partner Developers we strongly suggest that you migrate to `@reapit/cra-template-foundations` for a better developer experience and the LTS benefits of Facebook's React Scripts package.
