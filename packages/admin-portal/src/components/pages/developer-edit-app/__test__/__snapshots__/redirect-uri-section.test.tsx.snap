        If your App is a Private App and you would like it to only be visible to certain customers, please select ‘Yes’ below. You should then enter the ‘Customer ID’ of the customer(s) you wish to share your app with. If you select ‘No’, your App will be visible to all on the Marketplace. For multiple customers, please separate the Customer IDs using a comma, e.g. ABC, DEF.

        This field is disabled during the beta period. Your app will be private by default as the Marketplace is not yet live. You will have the opportunity to make your app private via an edit before setting it to be "Listed" in the marketplace when we move from beta to production.
