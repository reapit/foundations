                            A subscription for your organisation costs £150 per month. Additional costs are calculated based on the number of hours of that your warehouse is active in a given month, charged at £6.99 per hour. Your subscription includes 2 hours of warehouse uptime per month.

                            Your warehouse will become active when queries are issued against it. You will be billed by the minute while your warehouse is in an active state and ready to serve data. After a short period of inactivity, the warehouse will enter a sleep state. No usage costs are accrued when the warehouse is sleeping.
