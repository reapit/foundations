            <p>
              Reapit&#39;s data warehouse is a premium service that provides your organisation&#39;s data in an
              analytics focussed format. Our cloud-based warehouse technology is supported by all major business
              intelligence applications to allow you to extract new value and insights from your data.
            </p>
            <p>
              This application can provision a dedicated virtual data warehouse and allow you to manage which users and
              applications have access to it. The analytics area allows you to track live usage statistics and set
              limits on your monthly spend. For usage instructions, click here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Access requires a subcription and usage is billed based on your warehouses uptime. Your organisations
              virtual data warehouse will become active when you issue queries against it and suspend itself when not in
              use.
