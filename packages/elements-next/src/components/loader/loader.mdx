# Loader
Loaders are used as the loading component of each major section of a page in the interface

## Properties
<Props of={Loader} />

## Usage

### Basic
A simple loading status.
<Playground>
  <DocsWrapper>
    <Loader/>
  </DocsWrapper>
</Playground>

### Size
A small Spin is used for loading text, default sized Spin for loading a card-level block, and large Spin used for loading a page.
<Playground>
  <DocsWrapper>
    <Loader size="small"/>
    <Loader/>
    <Loader size="large"/>
  </DocsWrapper>
</Playground>

### Embedded Mode
Embedding content into Loader will set it into loading state.
<Playground>
    {() => {
      const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = React.useState(true)
      return (
        <DocsWrapper>
            <Loader isLoading={isLoading}>
              <div
                style={{
                  padding: 10,
                  border: '1px solid grey',
                  borderRadius: 5,
                }}
              >
                <h3>Your content</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>
                  Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged
                </p>
              </div>
            </Loader>
            <button style={{ marginTop: 10 }} onClick={() => setIsLoading(!isLoading)}>
              Toggle Loading State
            </button>
        </DocsWrapper>
      )
    }}
</Playground>

### Custom Loading Indicator
Use custom loading spinner.
<Playground>
    {() => {
      const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = React.useState(true)
      return (
        <DocsWrapper>
            <Loader isLoading={isLoading} indicator="Custom Loading Spinner...">
              <div
                style={{
                  padding: 10,
                  border: '1px solid grey',
                  borderRadius: 5,
                }}
              >
                <h3>Your content</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>

            </button>
        </DocsWrapper>
      )
    }}

            <Loader isLoading={isLoading} description="Fetching data...">
