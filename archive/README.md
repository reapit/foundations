# Package Archive

This folder contains an archive of packages now deprecated from the main packages directory. Typically they are either apps we are no longer actively developing, packages that are no longer in use or have been deprecated in favour of a new implementaion.

For future maintainers, there is a brief description of each package below to serve as a reference.

## Contents

### Cognito Auth

NPM module used to authenticate against Reapit Connect using the AWS SDK. Deprecated and replaced by Connect Session in the main packages directory.

### Demo Site

A simple HTML site to demo web components in. Not needed, can be re-built in a less complicated way when we start with Web Components again.

### Deploy Slack Bot

Bot to post release information to Slack From pipeline. Nice idea, needlessly over complicated for our needs.

### Elements Next

Experimental repo to re-build Elements StoryBook using Docz library. Discontinued development due to performace issues with the library and because we can better manage versioning of Elements from the main package.

### Lifetime Legal

Demonstration app built for the November 2019 Foundations launch to demonstrate white labeling of our AML Checklist app for a client. Discontinued development.

### Site builder

Prototype to compose Web Components into exportable sites using GrapesJS as a drag-and-drop interface. Discontinued development due to limitations of Grapes library.

### SMB Onboarder

App to onboard users to Agency Cloud desktop  CRM. Needs a re-thing and re-work of code to progress
